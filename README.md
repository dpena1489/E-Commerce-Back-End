## Description

This application allows users to manage products, tags, 
and categories for an e-commerce site on the back end using API calls.
 A user can retrieve data, add data, update data, and delete 
data from tables of products, tags, and categories. 

## Installation

This app requires  Express, Sequelize, dotenv, and pg are dependencies and PostgreSQL.


## Usage

Users will need to create the .env file with the database name with their PostgreSQL username and password. Then, users should run the db\schema.sql file to create the database schema. After, users should use the command 'npm run seed' to seed the database tables. After using node to start the server, an API client is used to make calls to the API. The routes can handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Information about how to structure those calls and the endpoints are available in the api folder under routes.
